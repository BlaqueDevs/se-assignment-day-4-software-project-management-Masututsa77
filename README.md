SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management

1.	Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure deadlines are met?
Timely delivery is crucial because it keeps the project on schedule and makes sure that the deadline is met.
Project managers can ensure deadlines are met by applying strategies like:
•	Ensuring timely delivery
•	Cost control
•	Quality assurance
•	Resource management
•	Risk management
•	Stakeholder satisfaction 

2.	How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Cost control manages the budget and prevents cost overruns
Resource management strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns:
•	Resource allocations by assigning resources based on project needs and priorities
•	Adjust start and end dates based on resource availability
•	Identify the longest path planned activities to the end of the project
•	Ensure optimal use of human, financial and material resource
•	Prevent resource overallocation and bottlenecks 

3.	Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile methodology is iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development. It emphasizes flexibility, collaboration and customer feedback
Advantages of Agile methodology are:
•	Quick response to changes
•	Regular customer feedback
•	Improved team collaboration
Disadvantages of Agile methodology are:
•	Less predictability
•	Requires significant customer involvement 

Waterfall methodology is linear and sequential approach and each phase must be completed before the next begins
Advantages of Waterfall methodology:
•	Clear structure and documentation
•	Easy to manage due to its rigidity
Disadvantages of Waterfall methodology:
•	Difficult to accommodate changes
•	Testing occurs late in the process

4.	In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile method will be more beneficial when developing project like e-commerce systems where changes can be made during the project development.
Waterfall method will be more beneficial when developing systems for government where the project will be aligned with the physical workflow.

5.	What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Quality assurance is process-oriented approach and focuses on preventing defects 
Quality control is product-oriented approach and it focuses on identifying the defect in the final product.
The project should meet the international standard for quality management systems.

6.	How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Scope in project planning:
•	Define project boundaries
•	List deliverables and objectives
•	Create work breakdown structure
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of a project into smaller, more manageable components. It breaks down the overall project into smaller tasks, deliverables, or work packages, each of which can be more easily planned, managed, and controlled.
Useful for:
•	Improve planning
•	Enhances communication
•	Facilitates monitoring and control
•	Clarifies responsibilities
•	Improves risk management
•	Ensures completeness

7.	What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
A detailed project schedule contains the following:
•	Schedule variance which measures the difference between planned and actual progress
•	Cost variance measures the difference between budgeted and actual costs
•	Quality metrics measures defect ratees, test coverage and customer satisfaction
Gantt charts assist with:
•	Visual representation of project schedule
•	Earned value management
•	Integrate scope, schedule and cost performance

8.	What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
My software aims to sell kids clothing at a very low cost to consumer
Most people can not afford quality clothes and online shopping is the cheapest way of shopping

9.	How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
When the problem is clearly defined it makes things easier to find solution that addresses the problem and countermeasures.

10.	How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
Define and explain the problem
State measures that have been taken against the problem that have failed
Give options on how to solve the problem
Introduce your solution
Detail the benefits of the software

11.	What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
Easy to use by anyone
Options will be photos and text for easy navigation
Few steps to follow 
Quick setup and sign up
12.	What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
Market is fast growing and most the people are going digital that being physical stores

13.	How can understanding market trends inform your software’s positioning and development?
Software is will grow and become more lucrative, easy to develop and easy to use
